## ❗️Problem – Current Challenges

### 🔍 Unreliable Forecasting Data  
Existing prediction markets and AI forecasting services struggle to provide trustworthy insights due to:
- Anonymity

- Noisy data  

### ⏳ AI Can't Truly Answer Questions About the Future  
Most AI systems rely heavily on historical data and lack real-time input from:
- Actual human expectations  
- Real-world sentiment

## 💡 Opportunity – Market Potential

### ✅ High-Trust Forecasting Data  
By using **World ID** to verify participants' identities, we can collect:

- Low-noise, reliable prediction data  

### 🔁 A Self-Reinforcing Feedback Loop  
As users place bets and express their expectations, the AI becomes smarter.
